                <p class="article-text">The Medieval Navigation Company was born out of the Arab Empire which is one of the greatest contributors to modern navigation technology. Because of the importance of sea travel in the empire, improvements and innovation naturally came. Especially with the lack of navigable rivers in the empire, a need for new tools arose. Now with the help of this state of the art technology, say goodbye to the days of only traveling close to coasts, and say hello to the open ocean. Bid farewell to only traversing well mapped and easy terrain, and say hello to the many wonders of the untraveled Earth.</p>

                <p class="article-text"><strong>The Kamal:</strong>  The Kamal is a tool used for celestial navigation. Mainly measuring latitude and has been the origin of latitude sailing, first used by Arab navigators. The kamal consists of a rectangular wooden board to which a string with several equally spaced knots is attached through a hole in the middle of the board. It is used by placing one end of the string in your teeth while the other end is held away from the body parallel to the ground. The board is then moved along the string, positioned so the lower edge is even with the horizon, and the upper edge is close to a target star. The angle is then be measured by counting the number of knots from the teeth to the card, or a particular knot can be tied into the string if you are travelling to a known latitude. </p>

Used to measure, the position of a astronomical object, this tool can identify stars and planets thus being able to to determine local latitude given local time and vice versa. Astrolabes can help with finding the time of sunrise and the rising of fixed stars in additon to latitude, being much help to sailors, traders, and merchants. It had even been used to schedule important events such as prayers with its amazing accuracy. </p>
